I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

    You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

    Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.
'''
age = input("What is your present age:\n")

years = 90-int(age)
months = round(years * 12)
weeks = round(years * 52)
days = round(years * 365)

print(f"You have {days} days, {weeks} weeks, and {months} months left.")
